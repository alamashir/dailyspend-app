## ✨ What Makes Daily Spend Different

### 🎙️ Voice Input
Speak your expense and we'll capture it instantly. Say "twenty dollars at Starbucks for coffee" and we'll automatically extract the amount, store name, category, and add it to your tracker.

### 🤖 AI Chat Assistant
Type naturally like you're texting a friend:
- "coffee $5"
- "50 at Whole Foods yesterday"
- "lunch 15 dollars"

Our AI understands and creates the expense entry automatically. No forms to fill out.

### 🔒 Your Data Stays on Your Device
Unlike other expense trackers, **your financial data never leaves your phone**. Everything is stored locally using encrypted storage. No cloud sync, no servers, no data harvesting.

### 📊 Beautiful Analytics
See exactly where your money goes with interactive charts, category breakdowns, and spending trends—all rendered beautifully in light or dark mode.

### 💰 Smart Budgeting
Set monthly budgets and get visual progress indicators. No nagging notifications—just helpful awareness of your spending.

### 🏷️ Fully Customizable
8 pre-built categories (Food & Dining, Transportation, Shopping, Entertainment, Bills & Utilities, Healthcare, Groceries, Other) plus the ability to create your own.

### 📤 Export Anytime
Your data, your rules. Export everything to CSV or JSON whenever you want. No lock-in, no hassle.
